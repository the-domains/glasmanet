# Where is the fish?

Every second year the best chefs in the world and their commis (assistants) gather in Lyon, France to compete the most prestigious competition of them all; the [Bocuse d'Or][0].

In 5 hours and 35 minutes, the team has to prepare a meat and a fish dish in front of judges and a very lively audience. The two dish themes are announced in advance, so the chefs and their commis prepare by setting up a kitchen in the same manner, experiment, focus on both mental and physical fitness, have a large support team and coaches, and dedicate a lot of time.

This is not very different from any other competition; either in sports, arts or business.

Being a IT business developer, I decided to apply my current abilities and practices to create a meal that is going to be fantastic!

As it's Sunday and I'm all by myself today, I don't have access to any groceries. And it would be very expensive too, if I were to try out all sorts of fish, meats and vegetables.

So I do what I know best: design it.

I decide to make a soup.

I decide on which flavours, texture and colours I'd like in my soup and combine these in a cube to balance off everything into a perfect combination. I design the the soup and package it into something that looks delicate to the palate.

By now the design looks so promising, I'm willing to commit my soup for supper.

Although not giving off much smell, I've decided to invite the new neighbours over for a taster; bonding our future.

If you weren't totally convinced by my ability to make soup, it is not just due to my cooking skills.

The aforementioned chefs have their daily profession at restaurants. When serving their meals, it is on a production line. However, they will loose clients, investors and careers if not adding something new to their menus.

Whenever you are moving into the unknown and the outcome is highly dependent of your skills and your resources, you better have both.
